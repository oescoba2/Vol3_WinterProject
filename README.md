This repo will store our work for our Vol III project. Each of us has a workspace folder where we can add things without asking any other person. You can delete the some.txt once you push something to your own directory, else your directory will be deleted. The rest folders are structured as follows

* srcCode: Directory meant to store final versions or final drafts of any code (e.g. plotting, modeling, data cleaning) that we will all use.
* 1stDraft: Directory meant to store the 1st draft files and images needed to compile our tex file
* Data: Directory meant to store all the data we will use. Data need does not have to be cleaned.
